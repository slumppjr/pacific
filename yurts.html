<h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
<h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
<dt>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four<br>
    feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed<br>
    with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof<br>
    dome that can be opened<br></dt>
<h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
<dt>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed<br>
    with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury<br>
    camping experience includes electricity and a<br>
    sink with hot and cold running water. Shower<br>
    and restroom facilities are located in the lodge<br></dt>
<h3>What Should I bring?</h3>
<dt>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes<br>
    and plan to dress for changing weather with<br>
    light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring<br>
    a flashlight and a sense of adventure!<br></dt>
